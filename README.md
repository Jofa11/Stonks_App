#### Buy, Sell!

### Well...
You can at least view some stock info from the ticker symbol you provide.

This is a tutorial project to get some reps with Django. Also, I'm planning a stock market app for a friend. This project gave me some great ideas and helped with finding a good API. 

### Technologies Used
This project is mostly Python, using Django. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for styling framework.
